"""
Orphan Process Reaper
=====================

Periodic background task that kills orphaned processes (PPid=1) inside the
container that were spawned by AutoForge but survived agent shutdown.

This is a safety net for the process-group kill mechanism. It runs every
60 seconds and kills any chrome, node, esbuild, or npm processes that:
  1. Have PPid == 1 (reparented to init — they're orphans)
  2. Are NOT the main autoforge-bin or uvicorn process
  3. Have been orphaned for at least 30 seconds (grace period)

Only active on Linux (containers). No-op on macOS/Windows.
